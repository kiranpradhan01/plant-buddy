# PlantBuddy
API: https://api.erikth.me/
Client: https://www.erikth.me/

## Project Description
The target audience for our application are all types of plant enthusiasts, from seasoned gardeners to aspiring plant parents. Plant enthusiasts will use this application to learn about different types of plants and share their thoughts or experiences caring for the plant. They can look through different categories of plants and find the right plant for them by learning from othersâ€™ experiences.

Our team members all have varying levels of experience with plants (one of our team members just killed his first plant and another has 17 plants!). We as developers want to build this application so that we can learn best practices from other plants owners and create a community where plant owners can learn from each other.
